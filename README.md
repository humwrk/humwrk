# Humwrk

Humwrk is little (maybe bigger) product that will be released by Araclx, Inc. (company founded by @ZiQiLN) in near time, however we're separated from main
company because Human Resources and building products related to Human Resources isn't main target of Araclx for this moment. This product will maintained to
the end because that's not only a freelance platform like in first concept but complete platform for human resources at worldwide scale.

## Development

Project currently is in early stage and scripts may be not up to date since there we're chaning a lot of things, but in general according to our plans for this
repository you need 4 things.

-  Prefferable **yarn**, but **npm** is also fine - that makes no difference to our solution.
-  **Skaffold** to handle CI/CD Pipeline
-  **Docker** for containers of course
-  **kubectl** for kubernetes obivo

To start with repository development you should at first **clone repository** with:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/humwrk/humwrk.git
```

And then you can simplify run development environment designed by us in single command.

```bash
$ yarn run dev
```
